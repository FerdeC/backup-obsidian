# [Rug of Smothering](2-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/rug-of-smothering.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 20, Curse of Strahd, Hoard of the Dragon Queen, Storm King's Thunder, Tomb of Annihilation, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus, Candlekeep Mysteries, The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, Keys from the Golden Vault. Available in the SRD.*  

Would-be thieves and careless heroes arrive at the doorsteps of an enemy's abode, eyes and ears alert for traps, only to end their quest prematurely as the rugs beneath their feet animate and smother them to death.

A rug of smothering can be made in many different forms, from a finely woven carpet fit for a queen to a coarse mat in a peasant's hovel. Creatures with the ability to sense magic detect the rug's false magical aura.

In some cases, a rug of smothering is disguised as a [carpet of flying](/2-Mechanics/CLI/items/carpet-of-flying.md) or another beneficial magic item. However, a character who stands or sits on the rug, or who attempts to utter a word of command, is quickly trapped as the rug of smothering rolls itself tightly around its victim.

## Animated Objects

Animated objects are crafted with potent magic to follow the commands of their creators. When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions. Some animated objects (including many of those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons.

### Constructed Nature

An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.
