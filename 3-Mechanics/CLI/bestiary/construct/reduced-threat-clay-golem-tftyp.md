- "desc": "A reduced-threat monster takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls (included in\
    \ the stat block), ability checks (included in the stat block for skill proficiencies),\
    \ saving throws (included in the stat block for saving throw proficiencies), and\

  "name": "Reduced Threat"
- "desc": "Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and\
    \ instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt."
  "name": "Acid Absorption"
- "desc": "Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, roll a\
    \ d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the\
    \ golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough\
    \ to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object\
    \ smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until\
    \ it is destroyed or regains all its hit points."
  "name": "Berserk"

    \ on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by\
    \ an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces\
    \ its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the  [greater\
    \ restoration](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or other\
    \ magic."
