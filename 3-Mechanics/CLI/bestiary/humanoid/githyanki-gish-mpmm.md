# [Githyanki Gish](2-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 140, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 205*  

Gish blend their magical abilities with swordplay to become dangerous foes in battle. Their specialized capabilities make them well suited for assassination, raiding, and espionage.

## Githyanki

Githyanki descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of githzerai (also in this book). These tall, gaunt folk have potent psionic powers and dwell, for the most part, on the Astral Plane. Among the best-known githyanki are the bellicose followers of the Lich Queen Vlaakith. They terrorize the Astral Plane, raiding into other planes to plunder the multiverse of its magic and riches.
