# [Hurricane](2-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/hurricane-pota.md)
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 191*  

Hurricanes profess their disgust with decadence, and they dedicate their bodies and their minds to the world's destruction. Through breathing exercises and ascetic philosophy, skilled Howling Hatred initiates learn to imitate the cycling patterns of the hurricane. They believe the physical world must be shattered so that the creatures of the Material Plane can live unshackled by physical things.

Hurricanes see the frenetic activity of the world in slow motion, and themselves at the calm center of the storm. Through meditation and mysticism they learn to summon powerful blasts of wind, catch missiles with ease, and fall like feathers.
