# [Skeletal Juggernaut](2-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/skeletal-juggernaut-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 253*  

As seen lumbering across the beaches in Isle of the Abbey, a skeletal juggernaut is an oversized, bipedal assembly of bones that loses a portion of its mass with each step. These skeletal guardians hold together for only a short time before disassembling into a gang of individual undead.
