# [Tyrannosaurus Zombie](2-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/tyrannosaurus-zombie-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 241*  

Several new zombie variants are presented below. For more information on zombies, see the Monster Manual.

## Ankylosaurus Zombie

This creature is slow and barely aware of its surroundings.

## Girallon Zombie

Girallons are four-armed apes with white fur. Girallon zombies are slower than their non-undead counterparts but no less fierce. The necromantic energy empowering them fuels their murderous hearts and their hunger for living flesh.

## Tyrannosaurus Zombie

A tyrannosaurus zombie has a gullet full of smaller zombies, which it can disgorge. These zombies aren't under the tyrannosaurus zombie's control.

- "desc": "As a bonus action, the tyrannosaurus zombie can disgorge a normal [zombie](/2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md),\
    \ which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. The disgorged [zombie](/2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md)\
    \ acts on its own initiative count. After a zombie is disgorged, roll a d6.\
    \ On a roll of 1, the tyrannosaurus zombie runs out of zombies to disgorge and\
    \ loses this trait. If the tyrannosaurus zombie still has this trait when it dies,\
