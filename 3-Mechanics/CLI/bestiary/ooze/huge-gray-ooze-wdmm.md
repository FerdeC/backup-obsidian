- "desc": "Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes. After\
    \ dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage\
    \ rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition\
    \ made of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.\n\nThe ooze\

    \ is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10."
