- "desc": "Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes. After\
    \ dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage\
    \ rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition\
    \ made of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.\n\nThe ooze\
    \ can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round."

    \ nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and\
    \ cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty\
