- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller\
    \ creature. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing\
    \ damage. The target is [grappled](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled)\
    \ (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target\
    \ is [restrained](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until this\
    \ grapple ends."
  "name": "Constrict"
- "desc": "The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide.\
    \ Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking\
    \ 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a\

- "desc": "The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is\
    \ grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple\
    \ ends. While swallowed, the target is [blinded](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded)\
    \ and [restrained](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total\
    \ cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6)\
    \ acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only\
    \ one creature swallowed at a time.\n\nIf the behir takes 30 damage or more on\
    \ a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14\
    \ Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature,\
    \ which falls [prone](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within\
    \ 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\
    \ by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)."
