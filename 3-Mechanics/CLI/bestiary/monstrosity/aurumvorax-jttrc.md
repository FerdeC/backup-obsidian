# [Aurumvorax](2-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/aurumvorax-jttrc.md)
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 105*  

Early in life, aurumvoraxes cooperate with siblings and their den leader parents, digging tunnels in search of metal and other burrowing prey. As they grow to adulthood, aurumvoraxes hunt on their own, carving out territories they viciously defend.

## Aurumvorax

An aurumvorax is an eight-legged, badger-like hunter. These aggressive omnivores attack any prey they think they can best, ambushing even creatures double their size. They supplement their diets with metal, whether it's worked or ore, and they have a particular taste for gold. This diet lends aurumvorax fur its golden sheen.

Alone or in small groups, aurumvoraxes dig deep in search of precious metals. Such exploration often leads them into conflict with subterranean settlements. As defenders of such communities often wear metal armor, aurumvoraxes prioritize attacking armored foes—whether that armor is metal or not.
