# [Tecuziztecatl](2-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/tecuziztecatl-tftyp.md)
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 245*  

A giant slug named Tecuziztecatl, the Lord of Snails. Tecuziztecatl (TayCOO-zeez-tay-COT-el) is highly intelligent and quite the boaster. In ancient lore it was considered to be related to the moon, a fact of which it is quite proud. During combat the slug will detail, in Olman, what it has in store for the characters and how hopeless their situation is.
